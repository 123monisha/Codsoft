        <h1><u>History:</u></h1>
        
        <p>Just as with any invention, it all started with an idea. The first concept of the car can be traced to Leonardo Da Vinci, the well-renowned painter, and inventor who was way ahead of his time. However, crediting someone with creating the first vehicle is a challenging task. But once you get past all modern features, like GPS, antilock brakes, and automatic transmission, you’ll eventually stumble upon Benz Motor Car No. 1.

Karl Benz invented the three-wheeled Motor Car, known as the “Motorwagen”, in 1866. It was the first true, modern automobile, and that’s why many name him the actual inventor. Benz also patented his throttle system, spark plugs, gear shifter, water radiator, carburetor, and other fundamental vehicle elements. Later, he created Daimler Group, a car company that still exists today. 

But that’s just the tip of the iceberg. Karl Benz also had a direct contender named Gottlieb Daimler, who also built the prototype auto on March 8, 1886. Preceding both of them was Nicolas Joseph Cugnot of France, who made his automobile in 1769. He is even recognized as the first person to invent one by the British Royal Automobile Club and the Automobile Club de France.</p>
