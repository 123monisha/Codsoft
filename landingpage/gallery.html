        <h1>TOYOTA</h1>
        <img src="dk.jpg">
        <p><b><h3>Towards the end of the nineteenth century, Sakichi Toyoda invented Japan's first power loom, revolutionising the country's textile industry. January 1918 saw him create the Toyoda Spinning and Weaving Company, and with the help of his son, Kiichiro Toyoda, Sakichi fulfilled his lifelong dream of building an automatic loom in 1924. The establishment of Toyoda Automatic Loom Works followed in 1926. Kiichiro was also an innovator, and visits he made to Europe and the USA in the 1920s introduced him to the automotive industry. With the £100,000 that Sakichi Toyoda received for selling the patent rights of his automatic loom, Kiichiro laid the foundations of Toyota Motor Corporation, which was established in 1937. One of the greatest legacies left by Kiichiro Toyoda, apart from TMC itself, is the Toyota Production System. Kiichiro's "just- in-time" philosophy - producing only precise quantities of already ordered items with the absolute minimum of waste - was a key factor in the system's development. Progressively, the Toyota Production System began to be adopted by the automotive industry across the world.</h3></b></p>

         <img src="taluk.jpg">
         <p><b><h3>The BMW name stands for Bayerische Motoren Werke GmbH. BMW was created in 1917 from the Munich firm Rapp-Motorenwerke. The company was incorporated into Knorr-Bremse AG in 1920 before being refounded as BMW AG in 1922. It was the successor of Bayerische Flugzeugwerke AG, founded in 1916. 1916 is therefore considered BMW’s founding year.<br>

        Rolls-Royce Limited was a British luxury car and later an aero-engine manufacturing business established in 1904 in Manchester by the partnership of Charles Rolls and Henry Royce. Building on Royce's good reputation established with his cranes, they quickly developed a reputation for superior engineering by manufacturing the "best car in the world". The business was incorporated as "Rolls-Royce Limited" in 1906, and a new factory in Derby was opened in 1908. The First World War brought the company into manufacturing aero-engines. Joint development of jet engines began in 1940, and they entered production in 1944.[1] Rolls-Royce has since built an enduring reputation for the development and manufacturing of engines for military and commercial aircraft.<br>
